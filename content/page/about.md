### Hey, I am Akash!!

âœ¨  I am a passionate engineer and developer with a love of tech. I seek to surround myself with motivated, like-minded engineers who inspire me. I am interested in all things related to technology and design, and my most recent career interests lie in Cloud Computing, Virtualization & Software Development. I am actively looking for challenging Software Engineering roles where I can use my capabilities through sincere dedication and hard work to move up the graph of the organization, and I always share my knowledge with the developer's community because I believe that only together, we can shape a better future.
