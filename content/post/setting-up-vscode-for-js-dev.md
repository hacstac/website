### Why Visual Studio Code ?? ðŸ’»

---

#### What is VS_Code? & Why is it so Popular?

Visual Studio Code (Vs-Code) is a source code editor developed by Microsoft that can be run on all major OS's in the world (Windows, Mac-OS, and Linux). It is free, open-source, and provides support for debugging as well as built-in Git version control, syntax highlights, snippets, and so on. The UI of Vs-code is highly customizable, as users can switch to different themes, keyboard shortcuts, and preferences.

<!--more-->

Vs-code has initially been announced in 2015 as an open-source project hosted on GitHub before releasing to the web a year later. Since then, Microsoft's code editor has been gaining popularity among developers.

In the Stack Overflow 2018 Developer Survey, Vs-code was ranked as the most popular development environment with around 35% out of over 100,000 respondents on the basis of its usage. More stunningly, this figure is about 39% in the web development field.

And with monthly updates, users can expect to enjoy an even better experienceâ€Šâ€”â€Šbug fixes, stability, and performance boosts are frequently pushed.
